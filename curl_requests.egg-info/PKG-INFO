curl_requests – Modern Requests-like HTTP Client

**curl_requests** is a modern Python library that mimics the `requests` API
while providing advanced network features and performance.  
It supports **HTTP/1.1**, **HTTP/2**, and **HTTP/3** (QUIC) via subprocess-powered `curl` integration.

### ✨ Key Features
- Drop-in replacement for `requests`
- Built-in support for HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3
- Cookie and session management
- Automatic retry and redirect handling
- No external dependencies beyond `subprocess` and system `curl`
- Works perfectly in Termux, Linux, or containerized environments
